# Fangqin Sun

That's my name. 

It is a unique name. I wouldn't mean if you forget my name or do not how to pronounce it. Just say, "Hey".  

## Where I am that do not change

I am Chinese. I come from Beijing.

I am a student as Purdue University. I study CS and PSY. I am not a good student. I always ask weird questions and do weird things. I am optimsitic about grade while I still can pass exam with a C. 

I think I have a little phnologoical **dyslexia**. I may have test on that this fall (2018) and I will update what expert advise here.

## Something about me do not hold for long

I like the way of life by Russell, "Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind." My life is, hopefully, easier than Russell's. I like communism and anarchism. I am a little cynic sometimes. 

I like religions, and I am not a believer in any way. I am more familiar with buddhism and christian.

I have always wantted to be a vegetarianism. 

## Something I want to write above but have not because I do not want to lie to you. 

+ I play music. 
+ I play games like a pro.
+ I like parties (more than 6 people).

--------
I do not have passion to make a complex io. Not planning to write any blogs as well. So, this is good enough for me.
