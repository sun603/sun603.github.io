# Fangqin Sun

That's my name. 

It is a unique name. I wouldn't mean if you forget my name or do not know how to pronounce it. Just say, "Hey".  

## Where I am that do not change

I am Chinese. I come from Beijing.

I am a student as Purdue University. I study CS and PSY. I am not a good student. I always ask weird questions and do weird things. I am optimsitic about grade while I still can pass exam with a C. 

I think I have a little phnologoical **dyslexia**. I may have test on that this fall (2018) and I will update what expert advise here.

## Something about me do not hold for long

I like the way of life by Russell, "Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind." My life is, hopefully, easier than Russell's. I like communism and anarchism. I am a little cynic sometimes. 

I like religions, and I am not a believer in any way. I am more familiar with buddhism and christian.

I have always wantted to be a vegetarianism. 

### My coding skill

I guess that's why people open this page. 

C and C++: I start c at summer 2017. Mostly just in class materials. 200 hrs. of experience?  

Java: Started in high school. Used in algorithm intro course. My most confident progarmming language. 400+ hrs.

ARM and machine language: ARM is learnd in computer structure class. It remind my of my primary school machine language coding experience. And how my teacher refused to answer the relationship bewteen PC and the digital board we were playing. 20- hrs.

Python: first used in AI club. For me, it is just a handy calculator. 5 hrs.

Others that not on applyiable level: git, shell, matlab, html5+ ...

end of poor coding skills

## Something I want to write above but have not because I do not want to lie to you. 

+ I play music. 
+ I play games like a pro.
+ I like parties (more than 6 people).
+ I am good at programming.
+ PHP is the best.

--------
I do not have passion to make a complex io. Not planning to write any blogs as well. So, this is good enough for me.
